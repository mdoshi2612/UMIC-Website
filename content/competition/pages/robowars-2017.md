The task demanded two bots, one remote-controlled and another autonomous with coordination between them. The remote-control bot was expected to carry out the tasks of box picking, holding and placing, climbing on inclined ramps, and shooting a dart at the target while the autonomous bot had to find the path in a line maze avoiding certain nodes, pick up, hold and place boxes and be able to recognize logos and directions using a camera. The problem statement was to pick and place 3 boxes on the arena at their marked destination squares, solving a line maze avoiding all black nodes, detecting directions and logos automatically and throwing a dart at a board all under 6 minutes. Our freshmen team managed to build both of these bots under a period of 3 months and participated in the competition held at Techfest-17
