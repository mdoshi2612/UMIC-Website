## DRDO DRUSE Program 2018

The aim of DRUSE 2018 was to create a platform for the development of futuristic defence systems. The participants were UG and PG from engineering backgrounds all over India. We participated with two different teams working on two different project ideas.

For the first one, we carried out the ideation and development of Military Grade Unmanned Surveillance Drone with mobility over water, land and air, where a differential drive mechanism was combined with Paddle Wheels for maneuvering over land and water with a multi rotor configuration to perform aerial maneuvers. Along with this an implementation of noise cancellation techniques for reducing the noise of multirotor for stealthy missions.

Along with this, the idea of an Autonomous All-Terrain Vehicle (AATV) for Armed forces was proposed to DRDO, where the AATV was designed to carry a payload of 200kg while following a human soldier and move on audio commands for unmanned scouting and surveillance for dangerous tasks such as mine detection before the entry of human soldiers. These tasks can be carried out by target detection and tracking using computer vision and path planning algorithms for smooth movement. Both these projects were presented to a 7 member expert panel from DRDO
