We were crowned as the champions in the Asia-Pacific region. The problem statement asked the participating teams to build a robot that could pick-up 16 balls (with their size varying from a Table Tennis ball to a Basketball) placed on top of 20 cm high PVC pipes and place them in a 50cm \* 50cm area without knocking the ball off its stand to the ground outside the above-described area within a short amount of time. The team with the maximum number of points would win the round. Eventually, we made it to the top in the Asia-Pacific region. Some of the most innovative design approaches used in this bot were the use and unconventional orientation of "mecanum wheels" for enhanced degrees of freedom of the robot as well as for the efficient movement of the robot over different types of surfaces, "forklift mechanism" for picking and storing the balls with pretty good speed and arm dropping mechanism for placing the balls in the above-mentioned area.
