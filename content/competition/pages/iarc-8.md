The team AeRoVe of UMIC trailed the problem statements of the IARC, the world’s premier and longest-running aerial robotics challenge, for the past two years and is consistently working and aiming to compete in the next edition. The primary purpose of the International Aerial Robotics Competition (IARC) has been to “move the state-of-the-art in aerial robotics forward” through the creation of significant and useful mission challenges that are ‘impossible’ at the time they are proposed, with the idea that when the aerial robotic behaviours called for in the mission are eventually demonstrated, the technology will have advanced to benefit the world.

Team AeRoVe has chased the Mission 8 of IARC since 2018. Presented with the “Best Presentation Award” in Mission 8 of IARC in Beijing, China, the team has developed a ‘swarm’ of autonomous quadcopter systems specifically designed to work under GPS-denied environments. Mission 8 focused on demonstrating technologies involved with Man-Unmanned Machine-Teaming (MUMT). In particular, a single human was to communicate navigation commands by either gesture or vocal commands to a team of four fully autonomous aerial robots. The key behaviours demonstrated included fully autonomous flight, execution of verbal or gesture commands from a single human, and deciphering and assembling noise-corrupted segments of a QR code to reveal an “unlock code” to communicate to the human team member.

The team has developed the required autonomous vehicle for the competition and is working towards making the system stable and sturdy than ever. The flight controllers used during the various instants of testing were different versions of PixHawk. Different sensors like LiDAR and Depth cameras are also installed on the vehicle to aid the mission. Finally, the drone uses Intel NUC as the onboard computing unit. This unit is what activates “autonomy” in the drone, and holds and executes all the Path Planning, Localisation, Machine Learning, Perception, and inter-vehicle communication algorithms. Regular testing of these algorithms on the aerial vehicle has helped in understanding the ambiguities in the system, and anchor these to perfect the operation of the vehicles.
