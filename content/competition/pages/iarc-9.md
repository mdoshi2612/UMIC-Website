The International Aerial Robotics Competition, the longest-running aerial robotics competition in the world, is the kind of problem that has pushed us to the best of our capabilities and made us think in ways like never before, providing us with an international platform to display our aptitudes.

In addition to the past technologies, Mission 9 required us to work on novel objectives like long-distance outdoor navigation, manipulation of large objects using actuators attached to our drones, interaction with moving frames of reference and 100% onboard computations. These tasks posed us with stimulating challenges and provided the team with the opportunity to improve its technical expertise.

Our solution to the problem statement was extremely innovative & indigenous. The hunter-killer vessel is located approximately 2.5 km off the coast. We use a Hex configured mother drone to deliver our daughter drone close to the ship. As the mother drone reaches close to the vessel, it hovers in a stable position while the daughter drone takes off from above the mother drone. The daughter drone moves towards the communication module while the mother drone returns to its home position. The mission is hence completed well within the time limits by sacrificing the Daughter drone.

Despite the ongoing pandemic, we braved our way through and not only succeeded to create a collaborative environment but also thoroughly enjoyed working on a collective goal, the IARC Mission 9 challenge.
