IGVC is an annual international robotics competition for teams of undergraduate and graduate students co-sponsored by Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI). The competition demands a fully autonomous unmanned ground robotic vehicle capable of negotiating around an outdoor obstacle course under a prescribed time under certain speed constraints, remaining within the lane, negotiating flags, and avoiding the obstacles on the course.

The team was subdivided into subsystems, keeping in mind the mechanical, electrical, and software aspects. The mechanical subsystem focussed on design aspects of the prototype, keeping in mind the modularity, stability, compactness, and sensor requirements. The electrical subsystem ensured proper electromagnetic wire shielding and requirements for mounting the onboard PC. The software aspects included colour channel extraction, high-speed motion planning, and integrated ROS implementations for efficient utilization of the system. This included perception for lanes, localization using GPS and IMU, and navigation. Initially, simulations were carried out on Gazebo before testing the software on the actual prototype.

The team globally stood fourth in the basic and fifth in the advanced Auto-Nav challenge in 2016. Improvising on the various aspects of the prototype, next year, the team emerged as the overall winners in IGVC 2017 in the pool of 29 participating teams from 5 different countries, securing first place in the Autonomous Navigation Challenge, second place in the Design Challenge, second place in the Interoperability Profiles Challenge. This has been one of the best performances by any Asian team in this competition to date.
