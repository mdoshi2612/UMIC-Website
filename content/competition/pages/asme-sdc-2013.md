The competition aimed to design a remotely-controlled, proof-of-concept vehicle for inspection purposes. The vehicle was capable of negotiating around obstacles, both in getting to the inspection points and in bringing the sensor back to the designated return area. The team from UMIC, IIT Bombay, were crowned as the champions in the Asia-Pacific region. We went on to participate in the world finals held at ASME's International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition (IMECE) and secured the 2nd position.
