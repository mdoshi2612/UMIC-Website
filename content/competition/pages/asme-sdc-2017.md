This year, we were crowned as the champions in the Asia-Pacific region as well as the World Champions. The problem statement asked the participating teams to build a multifunctional mobile robot that could perform the following five tasks:

1. Sprint: Touch a wall 10 meters away and return to start.
2. Throw: Launch a tennis ball along an axis.
3. Climb: Climb and descend a set of three steps.
4. Lift: Lift a weight vertically.
5. Hit: Hit a golf ball from the ground.

We achieved some great results in the world finals, Sprint: PID control and IMU-based small, fast car(20kmph) was used for completing this task. We completed the task in 7 seconds and secured 1st position. Climb: The rocker-bogie mechanism was used for the robot's fast and efficient motion while performing this task. We completed the task in 15 seconds and secured 3rd position. Lift: Scissor mechanism along with ball screw mechanism (which were capable of lifting heavy weights (80-100 kgs) upto the height of 1.3 m) were used to complete this task. We managed to lift a weight of 87 kg upto a height of 120 cm and ended up securing 1st position. Throw: High RPM(4000) Low torque motor along with rubber rollers with a gap slightly less than the tennis ball diameter was used to throw the tennis ball upto ranges of 40-50m efficiently. We managed to throw the tennis ball approximately 45 m far and ended up securing 2nd position. Hit: The mechanism used for completing this task involved the use of a high-speed motor connected to a hit rod. Besides this, the hit angle was optimized extensively for increasing the range upto 30m. We managed to hit the golf ball approximately 30 m far and ended up securing 1st position. One of the most innovative design approaches used in this bot was the use of the "Rocker-Bogie model" for completing the Climb task of the Robot Pentathlon.
