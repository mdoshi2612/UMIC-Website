The remote-control bot was expected to carry out the tasks of box picking, holding and placing, climbing on inclined ramps, and shooting a dart at the target while the autonomous bot had to find the path in a line maze avoiding certain nodes, pick up, hold and place boxes and be able to recognize logos and directions using a camera.",
